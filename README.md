# BusGo Project Overview & Guide

**Project:** A Modern Bus Booking Web Application\
**Primary Technology:** React.js

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is BusGo? (The Big Picture)

Welcome to the BusGo project!

At its core, BusGo is a fully interactive prototype of a modern,
user-friendly website for booking bus tickets.\
Our goal was to create an application that feels polished, professional,
and easy to use for everyone.

This isn't just a static design; it's a working application that
simulates the entire booking process.\
A user can:

-   Sign in with their name.
-   Search for bus routes between major cities.
-   Filter and sort the results to find the perfect bus.
-   Visually select their seats from a bus layout.
-   Go through a realistic payment process.
-   See all their past and upcoming bookings.
-   Even track their bus in real-time on a map!

Think of this project as the complete blueprint for our final product,
designed to be both beautiful and functional.

## 2. What Can a User Do? (Key Features)

We've packed BusGo with features to create a complete and realistic
experience:

-   **A Welcoming Login:** Beautiful, animated login screen that sets a
    professional tone for the app.\
-   **An Inspiring Home Page:** Encourages travel with featured
    destinations and testimonials.\
-   **Powerful Search Tools:** Filter by bus type (A/C, Sleeper) and
    sort by price, rating, or travel time.\
-   **Pick Your Own Seat Interface:** Interactive seat selection just
    like airline booking.\
-   **Smart Seat Locking:** Seats are held for 5 minutes with a
    countdown timer.\
-   **Realistic Payment Simulation:** Options for Credit Card, UPI, and
    Net Banking.\
-   **Personal Travel Hub ("My Bookings"):** View trip history and
    upcoming journeys with weather forecasts.\
-   **Real-Time Bus Tracking:** Track bus on a live map with accurate
    ETA.

## 3. How Does It Work? (A Simple Explanation of the Tech)

### 3.1. The "LEGO Bricks" Approach (What is React?)

The entire application is built using React. Think of React like LEGO
bricks -- reusable components (functions) such as `Header`, `Footer`,
and `BusList` are combined to build pages.

### 3.2. The App's "Brain" (State Management)

The app remembers data using **state**:

-   `useState`: Stores user name, page navigation, or selected seats.\
-   `useEffect`: Triggers actions at specific times (e.g., check if user
    is signed in on app load).

### 3.3. How It's Styled (Tailwind CSS)

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes like `bg-blue-500`, `font-bold`,
and `rounded-lg` for quick and responsive design without writing
separate CSS files.

## 4. A Quick Tour of the Code (Inside the Single File)

The prototype lives in a **single file** for simplicity but is organized
as if split into multiple files:

-   **Image & Icon Definitions:** Prepares images and SVG icons.\
-   **Mock Data:** Provides sample cities and buses.\
-   **Helper and Page Functions (Components):** From small pieces like
    `StarRating` to full pages like `Login` and `Home`.\
-   **Main App Component:** Holds state, logic, and decides which page
    to display.
