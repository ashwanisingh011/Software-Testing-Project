Local Setup and Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

Create a React App:

npx create-react-app busgo-app
cd busgo-app

## Install Tailwind CSS:

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

Configure Tailwind CSS:
Update your tailwind.config.js to scan your source files for class names:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

## Include Tailwind in your CSS:
Replace the contents of ./src/index.css with the global styles and Tailwind directives. (You can copy the code from the src/index.css file we created).

Add the Main Application Code:
Replace the entire content of ./src/App.js with the provided bus_booking_app.jsx code.

Fix the Entry Point:
Ensure the main entry file (./src/index.js or main.jsx) imports React. Add this line to the top if it's missing:

import React from 'react';

Start the Development Server:

npm start

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
